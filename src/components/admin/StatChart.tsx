/**
 * Purpose: A reusable bar chart. You'll use this component four times on this page.
 * Props: It should accept title (e.g., "Daily Logins") and data (an array of data points for the chart).
 * Recommendation: Don't build charts from scratch! Use a library like Recharts or Chart.js (with its React wrapper). It will make your life much easier.
