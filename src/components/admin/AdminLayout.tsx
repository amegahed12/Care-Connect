/**
 * Purpose: This component combines the Sidebar and Header and provides a content area for the specific page to be rendered.
 * Implementation: It will render the Sidebar and Header, and use the <Outlet /> component from react-router-dom to render
 * the child route (e.g., PlatformActivity, ManageDoctors).
