 * Purpose: The small, animated on/off switch.
 * Props: checked (boolean) and onChange (a callback function).
 * Recommendation: Use a headless UI library like Headless UI or Radix UI to build this.
   They provide accessibility and state management out of the box, so you just need to style it with Tailwind CSS.
