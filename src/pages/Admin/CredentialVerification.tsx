/**
 * This page is for approving or rejecting new doctors.
 * Implementation:
        This page will fetch only the doctors with status: 'Pending'.
        It will display them in a table. You can reuse the styling from your UserManagementTable but the "Actions" column is different.
        Instead of a toggle, the "Actions" column will have two distinct buttons: "Approve" (blue) and "Reject" (red).
        Clicking "Approve" should change the doctor's status from 'Pending' to 'Active'.
        Clicking "Reject" could either change their status to 'Rejected' or remove them entirely.
        The "View Documents" button would, in a real app, open a link to a PDF. For your project, it can just be a placeholder.
